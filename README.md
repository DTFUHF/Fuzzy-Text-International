Swedish fuzzy text watch
========================

This watchface is based on the PebbleTextWatch by waerewip (https://github.com/wearewip/PebbleTextWatch)

I wanted to combine the elegant layout and animations of the TextWatch with the natural language of
the Fuzzy Time watchface and I wanted it in my native language, Swedish.

Features:
 - Fuzzy time in natural language. (Swedish)
 - The large and easy to read fonts of the original Text Watch
 - Nice staggered animation
 - Between one and four lines of text, depending on need.
 - The text rows are always centered vertically
 - Smaller words may share a single line (such as "fem i")
 - Refactored code for better flexibility/rewriteability
