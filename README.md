Fuzzy Text International
========================

This is a watchface for the [Pebble][].  It is originally based on the
[PebbleTextWatch][] by waerewip , which reproduced the look of the Text
Watch that comes standard with the Pebble.

Mattias Backlund created a modified version, [Swedish fuzzy text
watch][], that displays fuzzy time.  Mattias wanted to combine the
elegant layout and animations of the Text Watch with the natural
language of the Fuzzy Time watchface, and wanted it in his native
language, Swedish.

This version builds upon the work by waerewip and Mattias: it supports
multiple languages, and provides options to change the visual style.

Features:

 - Fuzzy time in natural language
 - The large and easy to read fonts of the original Text Watch
 - Nice staggered animation
 - Between one and four lines of text, depending on need
 - Smaller words may share a single line (such as "fem i")

The following options can be configured, using the Pebble app on your
phone:

- Invert colors (white-on-black or black-on-white)
- Text alignment (centered, left, or right)
- Language

At this time the included languages are:

- English
- French
