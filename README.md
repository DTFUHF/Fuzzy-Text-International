Swedish fuzzy text watch
========================

This watchface is based on the PebbleTextWatch by waerewip (https://github.com/wearewip/PebbleTextWatch)

I wanted to combine the elegant layout and animations of the TextWatch with the natural language of
the Fuzzy Time watchface and I wanted it in my native language, Swedish.

The current version is mostly working. I have done some rather extensive refactoring of the data structures
to more easily accomodate four lines of text.
