Changes
========

The latest version is 1.2.1.  To update, remove the watchface from your
watch and then load it again from your locker.

The iOS version has to go through the Apple Store approval process - so
there will be a delay before iOS users are able to download the latest
version.  Wait for the Pebble app to update, then try updating the
watchface.

Android users do not need to wait for the Pebble app to update before
updating the watchface.
